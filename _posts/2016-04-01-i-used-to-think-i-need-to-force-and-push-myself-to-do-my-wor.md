I used to think I need to force and push myself to do my work. I thought the work is not well done if I am not exhausted after the day. I didn't rejuvenate. Now looking back, I remember how I called "not to have too many client meetings during the day" a relaxing day. Needless to say, I didn't have much to give to my family in the evenings and after a while, I didn't have much to give to my clients either. I had exhausted the one and only irreplaceable resource I had; ME. 

I did it because I felt I had to. I thought it was how entrepreneurs were supposed to be working. As if it is supposed to be hard. That is what productivity, focus and making money should feel like. I even had doubts. I thought that I am not cut out for this work. I remember thinking my family needs me too. All I wanted was to be happy and enjoy my work. I thought what if this is not meant to be and I should stop working. And I did. I stopped WORKING. I stopped pushing. I couldn't bring myself to create anything or even take care of anything to do with my business, let alone self-care.
I knew there had to be another way. Let's put it this way: I took the long route and did figure it out. I must say, it took me long enough, so it really doesn't need to take that long for you. 
Here is your shortcut, my six-week online course Feminine Way to Facebook Marketing. Join us to learn the new way.
It is not one magic trick to do or magic pill that you can take to fix everything. It is completely different, and it already exists in you and me and every woman entrepreneur who is trying to achieve success through masculine energy. You need to shift gears and become a woman you are meant to be. 
The push, struggle, pain and frustration comes only from one source. It comes from you not fully embracing who you are meant to be. You need to stop doing things the way you are lead to believe you need to do them and start tapping into your own wisdom. Your divine knowledge and understanding about you and your purpose on this Earth already resides within you. All you need to do is reconnect with it.
