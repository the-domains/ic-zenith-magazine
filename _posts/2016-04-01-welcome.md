There really are no words to describe how happy I am that you have found me, but I will try anyway. 

I have been thinking of you for a very long time. I have been pondering which way we could connect and speak about all the important things, matters of the heart really.  

As women entrepreneurs we have so many things on our plate all the time. We face vast amount of challenging situations in our work alone. Then there is the balancing act of our personal lives to add to the mix. We keep our deepest thoughts, dreams and desires hidden and we seem to be waiting for that right moment to bring them forth. The moment, which never arrives.  This magazine is my gift to you to. I aim to give you the support and encouragement you need to move forward and offer you ideas and simple solutions to improve your everyday life. Above all, I want this magazine to be a constant reminder for you to let your light shine bright.   Start realising your dreams. There really is no better time than this exact moment. I have filled this magazine with articles, solid advice and quick tips that you can implement in your own life. I will introduce you to some of the most exciting and talented people, who work with great passion in turning their dreams to reality. You will get a peek inside my life and you see how I keep my ducks in a row (most of the time). 

 This first issue is dedicated to you and to your life mission. It is time you gain clarity around the life you want to lead. I hope you enjoy the first issue of IC Zenith as much as I have enjoyed creating it for you. 

From my heart to yours,
