            <title><![CDATA[She stopped what?]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>She stopped what?</h1><p>I used to think I need to force and push myself to do my work. I thought the work is not well done if I am not exhausted after the day. I didn’t rejuvenate. Now looking back, I remember how I called "not to have too many client meetings during the day" a relaxing day. Needless to say, I didn’t have much to give to my family in the evenings and after a while, I didn’t have much to give to my clients either. I had exhausted the one and only irreplaceable resource I had; ME. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/81e41129-e7b1-4fca-9722-30302542a13b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The entrepreneurial freedom is a real deal</h1><p>I know for a fact, that entrepreneurial freedom is available for everyone, who embraces it and makes room for it in their life.  I live it, not yet financially free as the fashionable term goes, but as free as a bird, what comes to fulfilling my dreams and goals in business. But before that, there was some work to be done. Its your turn to tune into attitudes and core beliefs you have about working and especially about successfully working.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/8e567163-959c-4219-a64b-d82e68f823f5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
